Thanks for buying the Ferr2D Terrain Tool for Unity3D! We hope your experience with it is the best ever, and should it ever be less than that, please drop us a note and let us know!

If you see Gizmo icon related warnings, and/or the handles aren't displaying properly, please delete the Ferr folder, and re-install the plugin!

MENUS
GameObject->Create Ferr2D Terrain->Create Physical 2D Terrain (Ctrl+T)
	Creates a pre-built terrain object in the scene, with collider options on. It's the easiest way of creating a terrain object.

GameObject->Create Ferr2D Terrain->Create Decorative 2D Terrain (Ctrl+Shift+T)
	Same as previous, but with colliders off.
	
GameObject->Create Ferr2D Terrain->Create Terrain Material
	This creates a basic empty terrain material prefab. Hook up some materials to it, define some sides, and go!

Tools->Ferr->2D Terrain->Rebuild Ferr2D terrain in scene
	Forces all terrain in the scene to rebuild their meshes. Great if you've modified terrain materials with one scene open, but want to update the meshes in another scene.

Tools->Ferr->2D Terrain->Update scene Ferr2D objs with new material assets
	Looks for old format terrain materials (created in 1.0.9 or earlier) in the current scene, creates new formats when needed, and relinks objects with the new material assets!

Edit->Preferences->Ferr
	Various configuration options for visual and default values.

KEY CONTROLS
SHIFT+CTRL:  drag select path points
SHIFT+Click: add path point
ALT  +Click: removes path points
CTRL +Click: snap move points
Ctrl +R:     toggle smart snap
Ctrl +L:     toggle segment lock mode

KNOWN ISSUES
-If you drag your mouse outside the material editor window and let go while dragging a region, no undo data will be saved.
-Forcing an edge type on the closing segment will have no effect, however, forcing the edge type before the closing segment will affect both.

VERSION LOG

v1.11 2017-6
+Terrain
 -Added a Segment Lock Mode [Ctrl+L and scene menu] where you can override the random body texture segments
 -Edge texture slicing is now independant of path points, resulting in way less stretching
 -Path points now automatically compensate scale to keep the top and bottom of the edge parallel
 -New terrain material picker shows recently used, and utilizes Unity's object picker
 -Inverted fill now has controls for how far the outer area extends
 -Added a button for generating colliders in editor instead of at start
+Shaders
 -Improved falloff algorithm for lights
 -Added fog compatibility
+General
 -Fixed 5.6 warnings and updated minimum version to 5.3, initial 2017.1 compatibility check
 -Switched terrain materials to ScriptableObjects, old materials still work, but are phasing out
 -ComponentTracker is now gone, ScriptableObjects are king
 -Fixed various issues with undo and marking modified objects dirty
 -Changed namespace on Poly2Tri to avoid collisions with other tools, please modify if you already have a version in your project!

NOTE: Materials that were created in v1.0.9 or earlier will need to be upgraded to appear in the material selector. Visit each scene with terrain objects, and choose the menu item "Tools->Ferr->2D Terrain->Update scene Ferr2D objs with new material assets". This will automatically create new material assets and connect terrain objects to them! You can also create new materials through the "Create Updated Material Object" button on the old assets, and relink them manually.
